# Kickstarter_Challenge
Two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date and Written Report for Weekly Challenge 1

## Overview of Project
Continue to exercise my Excel prowess by creating two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date, as well as a written report.

### Purpose
>Louise’s play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that I’ve already combed through, I’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. I’ll then submit a written report based on my analysis and the visualizations I create.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
